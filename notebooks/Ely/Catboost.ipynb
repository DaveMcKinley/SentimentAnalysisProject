    "Build a model that can rate the sentiment of a Tweet based on its content.\n",

    "You'll build an NLP model to analyze Twitter sentiment about Apple and Google products. The dataset comes from CrowdFlower via data.world. Human raters rated the sentiment in over 9,000 Tweets as positive, negative, or neither.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aim for a Proof of Concept There are many approaches to NLP problems - start with something simple and iterate from there. For example, you could start by limiting your analysis to positive and negative Tweets only, allowing you to build a binary classifier. Then you could add in the neutral Tweets to build out a multiclass classifier. You may also consider using some of the more advanced NLP methods in the Mod 4 Appendix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation Evaluating multiclass classifiers can be trickier than binary classifiers because there are multiple ways to mis-classify an observation, and some errors are more problematic than others. Use the business problem that your NLP project sets out to solve to inform your choice of evaluation metrics.\n",
